git-flow
========

A collection of Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations
for Vincent Driessen's [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ "original
blog post").


Getting started
---------------
For the best introduction to get started with `git flow`, please read Jeff
Kreeftmeijer's blog post:

[http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)

Or have a look at one of these screen casts:

* [How to use a scalable Git branching model called git-flow](http://buildamodule.com/video/change-management-and-version-control-deploying-releases-features-and-fixes-with-git-how-to-use-a-scalable-git-branching-model-called-gitflow) (by Build a Module)
* [A short introduction to git-flow](http://vimeo.com/16018419) (by Mark Derricutt)
* [On the path with git-flow](http://codesherpas.com/screencasts/on_the_path_gitflow.mov) (by Dave Bock)


Installing git-flow
-------------------
See the Wiki for up-to-date [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation).


Integration with your shell
---------------------------
For those who use the [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or
[ZSH](http://www.zsh.org) shell, please check out the excellent work on the
[git-flow-completion](http://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) project
by [bobthecow](http://github.com/bobthecow). It offers tab-completion for all
git-flow subcommands and branch names.


FAQ
---
See the [FAQ](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/FAQ) section of the project
Wiki.


Please help out
---------------
This project is still under development. Feedback and suggestions are very
welcome and I encourage you to use the [Issues
list](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow/issues) on Github to provide that
feedback.

Feel free to fork this repo and to commit your additions. For a list of all
contributors, please see the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.

Any questions, tips, or general discussion can be posted to our Google group:
[http://groups.google.com/group/gitflow-users](http://groups.google.com/group/gitflow-users)

Contributing
------------
Fork the repository.  Then, run:

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:<username>/gitflow.git
    cd gitflow
    git branch master origin/master
    git flow init -d
    git flow feature start <your feature>

Then, do work and commit your changes.  **Hint**: ``export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH``
from within the gitflow directory makes sure you're using the version of
gitflow you're currently developing.

    git flow feature publish <your feature>

When done, open a pull request to your feature branch.

License terms
-------------
git-flow is published under the liberal terms of the BSD License, see the
[LICENSE](LICENSE) file. Although the BSD License does not require you to share
any modifications you make to the source code, you are very much encouraged and
invited to contribute back your modifications to the community, preferably
in a Github fork, of course.


### Initialization

To initialize a new repo with the basic branch structure, use:
  
		git flow init [-d]
  
This will then interactively prompt you with some questions on which branches
you would like to use as development and production branches, and how you
would like your prefixes be named. You may simply press Return on any of
those questions to accept the (sane) default suggestions.

The ``-d`` flag will accept all defaults.


### Creating feature/release/hotfix/support branches

* To list/start/finish feature branches, use:
  
  		git flow feature
  		git flow feature start <name> [<base>]
  		git flow feature finish <name>
  
  For feature branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `develop`.

* To push/pull a feature branch to the remote repository, use:

  		git flow feature publish <name>
		  git flow feature pull <remote> <name>

* To list/start/finish release branches, use:
  
  		git flow release
  		git flow release start <release> [<base>]
  		git flow release finish <release>
  
  For release branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `develop`.
  
* To list/start/finish hotfix branches, use:
  
  		git flow hotfix
  		git flow hotfix start <release> [<base>]
  		git flow hotfix finish <release>
  
  For hotfix branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `master`.

* To list/start support branches, use:
  
  		git flow support
  		git flow support start <release> <base>
  
  For support branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `master`.


Showing your appreciation
=========================
A few people already requested it, so now it's here: a Flattr button.

Of course, the best way to show your appreciation for the original
[blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or the git-flow tool itself remains
contributing to the community.  If you'd like to show your appreciation in
another way, however, consider Flattr'ing me:
