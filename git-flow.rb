#This patch makes sure GNUtools are used on OSX.
#gnu-getopt is keg-only hence the backtick expansion.
#These aliases only exist for the duration of git-now,
#inside the git-flow shells. Normal operation of bash is
#unaffected - getopt will still find the version supplied
#by OSX in other shells, for example.
